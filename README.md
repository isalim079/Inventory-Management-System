# Inventory Management System -React Project

## This is project made with React, Tailwind CSS, Material UI and some other packages

Inventory Management System is a web application where many shops can register their shop. There are 4 types of user in this project. 
   * Users who are not registered -just able to see home page
   * Registered user -they can create and register their shop
   * Shop owner -they can add their shop products and upgraded to role "manager"
   * Admin -they can do all those admin stuff

 * * Now It's time to overview the project.
  * In this project you can see a project overview on home page. I made the home page responsive. You can find there payment method included with stripe. I use Material UI and tailwind css for all my structure. On register page, some password validation added to make a strong password. One user can manage his entire shop using this system. Just user have to register his shop. There is payment system on this project. One user can not add many products. He has to buy subscription for his capacity. It is such a great friendly environment for all the users. You can see I use two basic color for full project. It gives you user friendly vibe. Like simple and minimal. I added image upload system for shop manager. So that they can easily upload their product image from dashboard panel. 
    I added project live link down below. If image not showing, try to give a hard reload. "ctrl+shift+r -in chrome"
